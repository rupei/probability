  """Computes the requested reductions over the `kernel`'s samples.

  To wit, runs the given `kernel` for `num_steps` steps, and consumes
  the stream of samples with the given `Reducer`s' `one_step` method(s).
  This runs in constant memory (unless a given `Reducer` builds a
  large structure).

  If one desires to sample from multiple chains in parallel, the
  `current_state` must be a `Tensor` with a leading batch dimension
  representing the number of parallel chains.

  The driver internally composes the correct onion of `WithReductions`
  and `SampleDiscardingKernel` to implement the requested optionally
  thinned reduction; however, the kernel results of those applied
  Transition Kernels will not be returned. Hence, if warm-restarting
  reductions is desired, one should manually build the Transition Kernel
  onion and use `tfp.experimental.mcmc.step_kernel`.

  An arbitrary collection of `reducer` can be provided, and the resulting
  finalized statistic(s) will be returned in an identical structure.

  Args:
    num_steps: Integer or scalar `Tensor` representing the number of `Reducer`
      steps.
    current_state: `Tensor` or Python `list` of `Tensor`s representing the
      current state(s) of the Markov chain(s).
    previous_kernel_results: A `Tensor` or a nested collection of `Tensor`s.
      Warm-start for the auxiliary state needed by the given `kernel`.
      If not supplied, `sample_fold` will cold-start with
      `kernel.bootstrap_results`.
    kernel: An instance of `tfp.mcmc.TransitionKernel` which implements one step
      of the Markov chain.
    reducer: A (possibly nested) structure of `Reducer`s to be evaluated
      on the `kernel`'s samples. If no reducers are given (`reducer=None`),
      then `None` will be returned in place of streaming calculations.
    num_burnin_steps: Integer or scalar `Tensor` representing the number
        of chain steps to take before starting to collect results.
        Defaults to 0 (i.e., no burn-in).
    num_steps_between_results: Integer or scalar `Tensor` representing
      the number of chain steps between collecting a result. Only one out
      of every `num_steps_between_samples + 1` steps is included in the
      returned results. Defaults to 0 (i.e., no thinning).
    parallel_iterations: The number of iterations allowed to run in parallel. It
      must be a positive integer. See `tf.while_loop` for more details.
    seed: Optional seed for reproducible sampling.
    name: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this function.
      Default value: `None` (i.e., 'mcmc_sample_fold').

  Returns:
    reduction_results: A (possibly nested) structure of finalized reducer
      statistics. The structure identically mimics that of `reducer`.
    end_state: The final state of the Markov chain(s).
    final_kernel_results: `collections.namedtuple` of internal calculations
      used to advance the supplied `kernel`. These results do not include
      the kernel results of `WithReductions` or `SampleDiscardingKernel`.

  """Implements Markov chain Monte Carlo via repeated `TransitionKernel` steps.

  This function samples from a Markov chain at `current_state` whose
  stationary distribution is governed by the supplied `TransitionKernel`
  instance (`kernel`).

  This function can sample from multiple chains, in parallel. (Whether or not
  there are multiple chains is dictated by the `kernel`.)

  The `current_state` can be represented as a single `Tensor` or a `list` of
  `Tensors` which collectively represent the current state. Note, if one desires
  to sample from multiple chains in parallel, the `current_state` must be a
  `Tensor` with a leading batch dimension representing the number of parallel
  chains.

  Since MCMC states are correlated, it is sometimes desirable to produce
  additional intermediate states, and then discard them, ending up with a set of
  states with decreased autocorrelation.  See [Owen (2017)][1]. Such 'thinning'
  is made possible by setting `num_steps_between_results > 0`. The chain then
  takes `num_steps_between_results` extra steps between the steps that make it
  into the results. The extra steps are never materialized, and thus do not
  increase memory requirements.

  In addition to returning the chain state, this function supports tracing of
  auxiliary variables used by the kernel. The traced values are selected by
  specifying `trace_fn`. By default, all kernel results are traced but in the
  future the default will be changed to no results being traced, so plan
  accordingly. See below for some examples of this feature.

  Args:
    num_results: Integer number of Markov chain draws.
    current_state: `Tensor` or Python `list` of `Tensor`s representing the
      current state(s) of the Markov chain(s).
    previous_kernel_results: A `Tensor` or a nested collection of `Tensor`s
      representing internal calculations made within the previous call to this
      function (or as returned by `bootstrap_results`).
    kernel: An instance of `tfp.mcmc.TransitionKernel` which implements one step
      of the Markov chain.
    num_burnin_steps: Integer number of chain steps to take before starting to
      collect results.
      Default value: 0 (i.e., no burn-in).
    num_steps_between_results: Integer number of chain steps between collecting
      a result. Only one out of every `num_steps_between_samples + 1` steps is
      included in the returned results.  The number of returned chain states is
      still equal to `num_results`.  Default value: 0 (i.e., no thinning).
    trace_fn: A callable that takes in the current chain state and the previous
      kernel results and return a `Tensor` or a nested collection of `Tensor`s
      that is then traced along with the chain state.
    return_final_kernel_results: If `True`, then the final kernel results are
      returned alongside the chain state and the trace specified by the
      `trace_fn`.
    parallel_iterations: The number of iterations allowed to run in parallel. It
      must be a positive integer. See `tf.while_loop` for more details.
    seed: Optional, a seed for reproducible sampling.
    name: Python `str` name prefixed to Ops created by this function.
      Default value: `None` (i.e., 'experimental_mcmc_sample_chain').

  Returns:
    checkpointable_states_and_trace: if `return_final_kernel_results` is
      `True`. The return value is an instance of
      `CheckpointableStatesAndTrace`.
    all_states: if `return_final_kernel_results` is `False` and `trace_fn` is
      `None`. The return value is a `Tensor` or Python list of `Tensor`s
      representing the state(s) of the Markov chain(s) at each result step. Has
      same shape as input `current_state` but with a prepended
      `num_results`-size dimension.
    states_and_trace: if `return_final_kernel_results` is `False` and
      `trace_fn` is not `None`. The return value is an instance of
      `StatesAndTrace`.
